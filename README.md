1) Originally an attempt was made to make this an m2e library but didn't work. I couldn't even get the example to work. 
2) Next step was make the project a jar and import it with resources. Didn't work.
3) Have the inheriting project virtually link to the folders for source and run the tests. This got ugly and kloodgy.
4) Copied the files from the project into the inheriting project.

Might reinvestigate 3.
